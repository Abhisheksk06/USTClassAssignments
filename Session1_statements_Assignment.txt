Communication and Reasoning Exercises
41. The statement that either p or q is true, but not both is called the exclusive disjunction of p and q, which we shall write as p # q. Give a formula for p # q in terms of the logical operators ~,  and .
p#q =  (pvq)^~(p^q)

42. The statement that either p and q are both true, or neither is true, is called the biconditional of p and q, and write it as pq. Give a formula for pq in terms of the logical operators ~,  and .
p<->q = (p^q)v(~p^~q)

43. Referring to Exercise 41, give an example of an everyday usage of exclusive disjunction.
You can have a tea or coffee, but not both

44. Referring to Exercise 42, give an example of an everyday usage of the biconditional.
You are eligible to vote if and only if you are atleast 18 years of age
